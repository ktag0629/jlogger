# Terminal Journal

I like to keep tabs of what I'm doing while on the computer. I already kind of do this on a notebook, I like to write down when I start and stop doing things. Helps me keep focus

Simple journal application

## Usage 

`jlog --quick "fixing bug from yesterday"`

Writes this timestamped to a designated log file, can be configured in some config file in ~/.config
